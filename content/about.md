# About Me

Welcome to my technical blog! I'm passionate about high-performance computing, machine learning, and low-level systems programming.

## What I Write About

This blog focuses on three main areas:

### CUDA Programming
Exploring GPU programming with CUDA, parallel computing patterns, and performance optimization techniques for GPU-accelerated applications.

### GEMM Optimizations
Deep dives into General Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) optimizations, exploring various techniques to achieve peak performance on modern hardware.

### Reinforcement Learning
Investigating reinforcement learning algorithms, their implementations, and practical applications in solving complex decision-making problems.

## Connect

Feel free to reach out or contribute to discussions on any of the topics covered here. I'm always interested in learning from the community and sharing knowledge.
